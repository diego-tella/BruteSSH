# BruteSSH
A simple Brute-Force for SSH developed in C#.<br>
This program was developed for study purposes only and to learn that, even using C#, a Microsoft language, it is still possible to create pentest programs that can attack Linux SSH servers and that it is possible to connect with them.<br>
The program is still in development and is not meant to be used in a pentest.
